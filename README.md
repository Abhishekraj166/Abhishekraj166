# üëã Hi, I'm Abhishek Raj

## ü§ñ Senior Software Engineer in Test at Miso Robotics

I'm a robotics software developer with a passion for building robust testing frameworks for advanced robotic systems. I have a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics and Controls) from the University of Illinois at Chicago and a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from BITS Pilani, Pilani.
Currently I work at Miso Robotics, Pasadena


### üîß Current Work

I've designed and implemented an automation test pipeline for testing robots in simulation on Google Cloud. This comprehensive solution includes:
- Creating the test framework architecture in Python
- Writing test cases for Motion Planning, User Interface, and SmartChef scheduler
- Implementing browser automation using Playwright for UI testing
- Establishing CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing and validation

### üíª Work Experience

Currently, I lead software testing initiatives for cutting-edge food automation robots at Miso Robotics:
- Architected and built an object-oriented test framework from scratch using C++ and Python, implementing modular design patterns for
scalable configuration management across robot subsystem assemblies and diverse hardware permutations.
- Designed and developed an enterprise-grade test runner with object-oriented architecture, featuring React/JavaScript frontend and
RESTful Flask API backend that orchestrates test execution in ROS Docker containers, with AWS CloudWatch integration for data
logging, Grafana dashboards for metrics visualization, and Slack API for automated notifications.
- Implemented a comprehensive unit testing framework with 95% code coverage using Google Test and pytest, establishing CI/CD
pipelines with automated test discovery and parallel execution for rapid feedback cycles.
- Built production-grade Software-in-Loop (SIL) and Hardware-in-Loop (HIL) testing systems with embedded Python integration, for
lifecycle testing.
- Developed full-stack UI test automation suite covering 90% of HMI functionality using Playwright and TypeScript, implementing page
Object Model Design Patterns for Maintainable Test Architectures.
- Designed and implemented functional, safety, and performance test strategies for continuous deployment across kitchen robotics
platforms using C++ and Python codebases.
- Created comprehensive fault injection libraries in C++ and Python to simulate sensor/actuator faults, validating system failover
behavior across diverse configuration permutations.
- Implemented CI/CD test pipelines with Jenkins and Docker, reducing firmware regression issues by 75% through automated
configuration verification and scalable testing infrastructure.
